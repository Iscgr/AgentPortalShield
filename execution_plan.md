# Execution Plan for Payment Allocation Bug

## Phase 0: System Model
- **Architecture:** 3-Tier (Client, Server, DB).
- **Key Files:** 
  - `server/services/enhanced-payment-allocation-engine.ts` (Payment allocation logic)
  - `server/storage.ts` (Database operations and payment management)
  - `server/routes.ts` (Payment allocation routes)
  - `shared/schema.ts` (Database schema)
- **Problem Flow:** 
  1. Payments are created correctly
  2. Auto/manual allocation functions execute without errors
  3. Payment records show `isAllocated: true` temporarily
  4. After allocation, payments revert to `isAllocated: false`
  5. This causes financial calculations to be incorrect

## Phase 1: Deliberation Summary
- **STA Proposal:** The issue is in the Enhanced Payment Allocation Engine where allocation creates new payment records instead of properly linking to invoices.
- **SBS Critique:** This creates duplicate payment records and doesn't properly maintain the allocation state. The original payment remains unallocated while new allocation records are created.
- **Converged Solution:** 
  1. Fix the allocation engine to properly update payment allocation status
  2. Ensure invoice-payment relationships are correctly maintained
  3. Add comprehensive validation and rollback mechanisms
  4. Fix the storage methods to handle allocation state correctly

## Phase 2.A: Change Vector

### 1. `server/services/enhanced-payment-allocation-engine.ts`
- **Action:** `proposed_file_replace_substring`
- **Find:** The autoAllocatePayment method that creates new payment records instead of allocating existing ones
- **Replace with:** Corrected logic that properly allocates payments to invoices without creating duplicates

### 2. `server/services/enhanced-payment-allocation-engine.ts`
- **Action:** `proposed_file_replace_substring`  
- **Find:** The manualAllocatePayment method with similar issues
- **Replace with:** Fixed manual allocation that maintains proper payment state

### 3. `server/storage.ts`
- **Action:** `proposed_file_replace_substring`
- **Find:** autoAllocatePaymentToInvoices method
- **Replace with:** Corrected implementation that doesn't create duplicate payments

### 4. `server/storage.ts`
- **Action:** `proposed_file_replace_substring`
- **Find:** manualAllocatePaymentToInvoice method
- **Replace with:** Fixed manual allocation method

## Phase 2.B: Validation Plan
- **Command 1:** `proposed_shell_command` with `command: "npm run dev"`
- **Command 2:** Test payment allocation functionality
- **Command 3:** Verify payment allocation status persistence

## PLAN COMPLETE & VALIDATED
