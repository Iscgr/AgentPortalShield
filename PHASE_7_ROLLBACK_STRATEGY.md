# PHASE 7: Database Query Optimization - Rollback Strategy

## ATOMOS Protocol Rollback Plan

### Immediate Rollback (if issues detected):

```bash
# Revert unified-financial-engine.ts changes
git checkout HEAD~1 -- server/services/unified-financial-engine.ts

# Revert unified-financial-routes.ts changes  
git checkout HEAD~1 -- server/routes/unified-financial-routes.ts

# Restart application
npm run dev
```

### Validation Tests Before Rollback:
1. **Performance Test**: Response time should be < 500ms for 50 representatives
2. **Accuracy Test**: Financial calculations must match individual queries
3. **Memory Test**: No memory leaks during batch processing

### Success Criteria (No Rollback Needed):
- ✅ Query count reduced by >90%
- ✅ Response time improved by >80%
- ✅ Zero accuracy loss in financial calculations
- ✅ Cache hit ratio >80% for repeat requests

### Emergency Fallback:
If optimization causes issues, the original `calculateRepresentative()` method remains unchanged and can be used with Promise.all() as a temporary measure.

### Monitoring Metrics:
- Database query count per request
- API response time for /all-representatives
- Memory usage during bulk calculations
- Cache performance statistics

## Rollback Trigger Conditions:
1. Response time > 2 seconds for any request
2. Any financial calculation inaccuracy
3. Memory usage exceeding 500MB
4. Database connection timeouts
5. Cache invalidation failures

**Rollback Decision Authority**: Automatic if any trigger condition is met
**Rollback Testing**: All tests must pass before considering rollback complete
