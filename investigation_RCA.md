# Root Cause Analysis - Payment Allocation Bug

## Data Flow Trace:
1. Payment allocation request → Enhanced Payment Allocation Engine
2. Validation passes correctly
3. Database transaction starts
4. Payment amount updated correctly
5. **FAILURE POINT**: Line 629 - `allocationPayment.id` references undefined variable
6. Transaction fails and rolls back
7. Payment shows as unallocated despite successful initial processing

## Falsifiable Hypothesis:
The `allocationPayment` variable is referenced in the audit trail creation but is never defined in the `manualAllocatePayment` method, causing a ReferenceError that breaks the allocation process.

## Code Evidence:
```typescript
// Line 629 in manualAllocatePayment method:
allocationPaymentId: allocationPayment.id,  // ❌ UNDEFINED VARIABLE
```

This variable was likely intended to reference a separate allocation record, but the current implementation directly updates the original payment instead of creating a separate allocation record.
