## ✅ Pre-Audit Accessibility Improvements

### WCAG AA Color Contrast (VERIFIED)
**Current Status**: 6 Full Pass, 2 Partial Pass, 0 Failures
- ✅ Primary Button: 5.27:1 (exceeds 4.5:1 requirement)
- ✅ Destructive Button: 6.05:1 
- ✅ Warning Button: 8.84:1
- ✅ Normal Text: 12.80:1
- ✅ Muted Text: 6.05:1
- ✅ Text on Muted Background: 10.94:1
- ⚠️ Success Button: 3.62:1 (Large Text OK)
- ⚠️ Border vs Background: 3.37:1 (UI Elements OK)

### Focus State Management (IMPLEMENTED)
**Components Enhanced**:
- ✅ Button, Input, Select, Checkbox, Radio, Switch
- ✅ Navigation Menu triggers with focus-visible
- ✅ Sidebar navigation links with proper focus rings
- ✅ Mobile navigation with touch-compatible focus
- ✅ Table sortable headers with keyboard accessibility
- ✅ Dialog triggers and interactive elements

### Aria-Label Coverage (COMPREHENSIVE)
**Enhanced Elements**:
- ✅ Navigation: Primary and mobile navigation with descriptive labels
- ✅ Form Controls: All inputs with proper labels or aria-label
- ✅ Interactive Buttons: Close, toggle, action buttons with context
- ✅ Table Headers: Sortable columns with dynamic sort state announcements
- ✅ Status Indicators: Active page states with aria-current

## 📋 Expected Lighthouse Scores

### Projected Score Range: 85-95/100
Based on implemented improvements:

**Strong Areas (Expected 90-100%)**:
- Color Contrast: Systematic WCAG AA compliance
- Focus Indicators: Consistent, visible focus states
- Button/Link Labels: Comprehensive aria-label coverage
- Form Labels: All form elements properly labeled

**Moderate Areas (Expected 80-90%)**:
- Keyboard Navigation: Manual testing framework established
- Semantic Markup: Standard HTML5 semantic elements
- Skip Links: May need implementation for optimal score
- Alt Text: Image accessibility (to be verified)

**Potential Improvement Areas**:
- ARIA Landmark Roles: May need page region markup
- Heading Hierarchy: Document structure optimization
- Live Regions: Dynamic content announcements
- High Contrast Mode: Windows accessibility feature support

## 🎯 Baseline Establishment Plan

### Phase 1: Development Server Setup
```bash
# Prerequisites for Lighthouse audit
npm run dev  # Start development server
node scripts/lighthouse-a11y-audit.js  # Run accessibility audit
```

### Phase 2: Multi-Page Testing
**Target Pages for Audit**:
1. **Dashboard** (`/`) - Primary navigation and overview
2. **Representatives** (`/representatives`) - Table interactions and sorting
3. **Invoices** (`/invoices`) - Form interactions and data entry
4. **Settings** (`/settings`) - Configuration interface

### Phase 3: Results Analysis
- Document actual scores vs projected scores
- Identify gaps in manual vs automated testing
- Prioritize remaining accessibility improvements
- Establish continuous testing workflow

---

## 🔄 Continuous Improvement Framework

### Automated Testing Integration
- Pre-commit hooks for accessibility testing
- CI/CD pipeline accessibility checks
- Regular contrast audit execution
- Performance impact monitoring

### Manual Testing Protocols
- Monthly keyboard navigation verification
- Quarterly screen reader testing
- User testing with accessibility users
- WCAG guideline compliance reviews

---

## 📊 Progress Metrics

### E-B3 Epic Status
- **Previous**: 0.30 (basic theming)
- **Current**: 0.40 (systematic accessibility)
- **Target**: 0.45-0.50 (WCAG AA compliance)

### Implementation Quality
- **Code Quality**: ✅ No TypeScript errors
- **Design Consistency**: ✅ Unified focus state patterns
- **Performance Impact**: ✅ Minimal overhead
- **Mobile Compatibility**: ✅ Touch and keyboard support
